<h1> <em> WHY ONLY CANADA</em> </h1>
<img src="canadan modi.jfif"> </img src>
<p4> from many past years <strong>Canada has been a top of the line preference for the Indian Citizens</strong></br>
So whats the primary reason for such a such a success . Well the answer is simple</br>
Canada has been very welcoming to various migrations accross the globe</br>

Canadas quality life index is also one of worlds best , with the average lifespan over 82 years </br>
it is the country everyone should prefer to go to.Tax in Canada is higher than that of India , but guyzz </br>
believe me its completely worth it. I would suggest everyone to go to canada to explore various study opportunities for their children</br>
